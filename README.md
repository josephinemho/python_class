# python_class Syllabus

## Class 1: Setting up your environment 
* Access our class server `python-class` with SSH key (securely sent over via https://onetimesecret.com/)
 * Discuss secret and public keys
* **Docker** (break down commands and flags)
* **Github** (add keys, create your own repository to push your work to)
 * Pull from **my** repository, push to **your** repository
 * Duplicate each notebook and add your name to the end of it (to avoid merge conflicts) - see [0.daily_tasks.ipynb](https://github.com/josephinemho/python_class/blob/master/0.daily_tasks.ipynb)
 * The `.gitignore` file
* **Jupyter** server (explore dockerfile, pulled layers)

**Homework**
* What's something you would like to script out in Python? Identify a task you do repeatedly. We will work on a real-world application on week 4.


## Class 2: Exploring variables & data types

**Homework**
* Do [0.homework.ipynb](https://github.com/josephinemho/python_class/blob/master/0.homework.ipynb)

**Resources**
* [Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org/) does a great job explaining Python essentials and includes tons of example code.
* If you prefer interactive exercises, try these lessons from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): "Python Lists and Dictionaries" and "A Day at the Supermarket".
* If you have more time, try missions 2 and 3 from [DataQuest's Learning Python course](https://www.dataquest.io/course/learning-python).
* [My code isn't working](http://www.tecoed.co.uk/uploads/1/4/2/4/14249012/624506_orig.png) is a great flowchart explaining how to debug Python errors.
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is Python's "classic" style guide, and is worth a read if you want to write readable code that is consistent with the rest of the Python community.
* If you want to understand Python at a deeper level, Ned Batchelder's [Loop Like A Native](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html) and [Python Names and Values](http://nedbatchelder.com/text/names1.html) are excellent presentations.
* [The 35 Words You Need to Python](https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/) - this article goes through python's 35 keywords with very good exposition. 

## Class 3: Foundations

**Homework**
* Finish [0.homework.ipynb](https://github.com/josephinemho/python_class/blob/master/0.homework.ipynb)
* Extra practice: do [3.loops.ipynb](https://github.com/josephinemho/python_class/blob/master/3.foundations/3.loops.ipynb)


## Class 4: Scripting
