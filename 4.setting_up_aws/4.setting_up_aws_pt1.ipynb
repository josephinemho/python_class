    "**Note**: The terminology can be a bit confusing. AWS refers to an uploaded **public key** as a “key pair.” To be clear, you are uploading the public component of a key pair you have created on your system (e.g. `id_rsa.pub`). The **private** key will remain on your system (e.g. `id_rsa`).\n",

    "Launch your very own server using AWS EC2. EC2 is the most popular service offered by Amazon Web Services and stands for \"Elastic Compute Cloud\". For our purposes, compute capacity means a cloud-based computer you will use to run your platform. Read more about EC2 [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). Costs are free for the first 12 months as long as you stay within certain usage limits, such as only running one server at a time (i.e. T-2.micro). \n",

    " * The first tab is “Choose AMI.” An AMI is an [Amazon Machine Image](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) and contains the software you will need to run your sandbox machine. I recommend choosing the latest stable Red Hat Server release that is free-tier eligible.

    " * The fifth tab \"Add Tags\" can be safely ignored\n",
